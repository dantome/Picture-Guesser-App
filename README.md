# Picture-Guesser-App
Picture guessing app using SwiftUI.
Designed for fun and to learn more of SwiftUI.
There are preuploaded pictures that the user will be playing with.  User slowly reveals parts of the image and can attempt to guess what the hidden image is.  The more hidden the picture is, the more points the user will be rewarded with upon answering correctly.

In later versions, user will be able to upload their own pictures and personalize their experience.
